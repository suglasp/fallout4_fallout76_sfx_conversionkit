Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 sound (sfx) and music Powershell conversion kit for PC.

-----
>> conversion kit updates, fixes and patches:

Update 19/03/2020:
'fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1' is a backport of script 'fo76_ba2_archive_extracter_early_test.ps1'.
The first one extracts only sound files (*.xwm and *.fuz files). The latter extracts all files from a 'General BA2' Archive type of files.

There are 3 Fallout BA2 known archive types:
GNRL = General Archive  -> supported to unpack
DX10 = Textures Archive -> unsupported to unpack
GNMF = PS4 Archive      -> unsupported to unpack

Update 22/04/2020:
Since Wastelanders update for Fallout 76, ba2 archives with voice files (like for example "SeventySix - Voices".ba2) do not contain xWMA (*.xwm) formats anymore, but the Skyrim Fuze (*.fuz) format.
Fuze files (*.fuz) are actually a format with xWMA data and also include lipsync meta data (*.lip).
In fact, a fuze file, is a file with two combined files stitched together.

Update 05/01/2020:
- Made some small fixes to the script.
- Main functions arguments where not passed.
- Arguments datatype is now pre-defined as string array
- Extract path used a dot notation (Powershell), changed this so the script fill's in full path. Extract would fail to the Windows System folder when ran with a standard powershell startup shell.
- Now extracts the *.fuz files and *.xwm files
- Added new script convert_fuz_to_xwm.ps1 to convert fuz to xwm files.
- Convert scripts now start conversion tools with High priority, for faster processing.

Update 06/01/2020:
- Convert scripts now support a custom path through the parameter -CustomDir <dir>
- Script "convert_wav_to_mp3.ps1" got a bug that didn't trigger ffmpeg.exe
- Updated comments in scripts with info how to run scripts and optional parameters.

Update 07/01/2020:
- The sfx extract script, fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1, will now auto include <Fallout install path>\Data when a custom path is entered.
- Added -help parameter for cli help

Update 11/01/2021:
- Improved Fallout default game installation path checking in the main script(s)
- Fixed a few typo's in comments

Update 04/10/2021:
- Small optimization in code.

Update 22/02/2022 (NOTICE):
- Bethesda.net launcher will be retired between April-May 2022. After that time, i will update the scripts to point default to the Steam version.

Update 11/03/2023:
- Changed routine to hunt down install paths for FO4, FO76, FO76PTS.
  Bethesda.net launcher code is removed and also the "fixed" Steam installer locations.
  The code now hunts down the paths from Valve Steam installer locations in Windows registry.

-----

>> In high level overview, these are the steps we do:
- Search inside the *.ba2 Fallout archive files for *.xwm (or now more recent also *.fuz) files.
- Extract these files and write to disk.
- Run a second tool to convert the *.fuz files to *.xwm.
- Run a third tool to convert the *.xwm files to RIFF (wav files).
- Run a fourth tool to convert the *.wav files to mp3. [optional]

----

>> Future project steps:
- Include powershell code for in bulk, read a *.xwm (xWMA format) and write it to wav file.
- Include powershell code for in bulk, read a *.fuz (special xWMA format) and write it to wav file.
- Make it so, if we detect Powershell version 7+, we process in parallel.

>> Current method to extract:

Steps:
Step 1) -> this takes the longest. This will generate a lot of Gigabytes of data!
Download the Extraction tool here https://github.com/suglasp/fallout4_fallout76_sfx_conversionkit/fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1    ( or download the B.E.A. Tool https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/78/? )

Parameters (optional):
fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1 [-InstallPath <fallout4_fallout76_installpath>] [-Fallout "Fallout4"|"Fallout76"|"Fallout76PTS"] [-ExtractDir <extract_dir>]


Open powershell and run .\fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1.

Default, the script will search in the Steam or Bethesda Launcher installation folders.
If you installed FO4 of FO76 in a custom path, use the flag .\fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1 -InstallPath <path>
The script above will search all *.ba2 files, and will start extracting all *.xwm files or *.fuz files automatically.

Default, the script will target 'Fallout76'. If you want Fallout 4,
then use the flag .\fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1 -Fallout "Fallout4".

Default, the script will create a subfolder "extracted_sfx" in the folder where it is ran.
If you want to change the extraction path, use the flag .\fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1 -ExtractDir "<full path to folder>"


For your information, the files of interest are for each Fallout[4|76] game in the "<game install folder>\Data".

For FO76, you want mainly these files for sfx/music extraction:
- SeventySix - Sounds01.ba2
- SeventySix - Sounds02.ba2
- SeventySix - Voices.ba2
- SeventySix - Startup.ba2
- SeventySix - ??UpdateStream.ba2  (Where ?? is a double number from 00, 01, 02 to .. for each Fallout 76 released Bethesda patch)

For FO4, you want these files for sfx/music:
- Fallout4 - Sounds.ba2

The extract script will locate the archive files automatically.
When running the script, it will index all *.ba2 files and start extracting all files.


Step 2)  -> prepare for conversion of xwm files to wav/mp3
Copy convert_wav_to_mp3.ps1, convert_fuz_to_xwm.ps1 and convert_xwm_to_wav.ps1 to the extract folder.
Make a subfolder "ffmpeg"
Make a subfolder "xWMAEncode"
Make a subfolder "fuze"

Download BmlFuzDecode.exe to the folder "fuze" from https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73100/ (download BmlFuzTools and extract the zip file. Copy *.exe files to "fuze" folder).
Download xWMAEncode.exe to the folder "xWMAEncode" from https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32075/?tab=files and extract to folder "xWMAEncode".
Download ffmpeg static compiled for Windows to "ffmpeg" from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows and extract to folder "ffmpeg". (*)

(*) Inside the "ffmpeg" folder, there needs to be a "bin" folder (so, ..\ffmpeg\bin) where you put the ffmpeg.exe file.


Step 3)  -> follow each step as described. This will generate a lot of Gigabytes of data!
Start powershell
Set-Location <path_of_ExtractDir> (see above with fo76_ba2_archive_extract_sounds.ps1)
.\convert_fuz_to_xwm.ps1    <- this converts all *.fuz to *.xwm files (raw)
.\convert_xwm_to_wav.ps1    <- this converts all *.xwm to *.wav files (raw)
.\convert_wav_to_mp3.ps1    <- this converts all *.wav to *.mp3 files (compressed)  [optional]

Parameters (optional):
.\convert_XXX_to_XXX.ps1 [-CustomDir <custom_path_dir>]


Have fun,
